		<p class="container"><p>I am in a club called Nittany Data Labs at Penn State University. As a member of this club we are given a premium subscription to the Dataquest platform (<a href="dataquest.io">dataquest.io</a>). Since I was given this subscription I wanted to take advantage of it. Dataquest has different paths to take and to start off I have chosen to take the Data Scientist in Python path. Thanks to my own personal projects I was experienced in python, but this is the first time I have touched the Jupyter notebook platform. After using Jupyter I have found that it is a good format to explain what the code is doing to the data, and why you are doing it. </p>
<p>This is the first project that was given to me through the Dataquest platform. I was tasked with analyzing the app data from the Apple iOS Store and the Google Play Store to find where a software development company should focus their development efforts. </p>
<p>Below you will find a copy of the Jupyter notebook as an image, if you want to download the file and view the hyper-links, go to the GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/gvonting/jupyter_popular_app_analysis">here.</a></p>
