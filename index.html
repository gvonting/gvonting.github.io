<p>I'm Garrett von Ting. I enjoy solving problems with programming and spending time in the great outdoors. So if you need to get in touch, I will either be at my computer, or as far away from it as I can get. </p>
<p>Currently I am a student studying at Penn State University. I grew up in California and was itching to try something new, I figured moving a few thousand miles to go to school in State College Pennsylvania was a good first step. During my time up in State College I have been able to get involved with clubs that have enabled me to work on programming projects corroboratively with others, as well as spend more time in the surrounding state parks.</p>
<p>In my free time I have also been able to work on some personal projects which you can find in the blog section of my website. If you want to know more about my skills they will be detailed in the about section and if you want to get in touch you can reach me at: <strong>gvonting@gmail.com</strong></p>
